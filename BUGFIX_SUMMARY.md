# Bug Fix Summary - Zombie Defense Game

## Bugs Found and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Player Import in Zombie.ts**
**Location:** `client/src/actors/Zombie.ts`
**Problem:** The `Player` class was used in collision detection but never imported.
**Fix:** Added `import { Player } from './Player';`

### 2. **Missing Player Import in Resource.ts**
**Location:** `client/src/actors/Resource.ts`
**Problem:** The `Player` class was used in collision detection but never imported.
**Fix:** Added `import { Player } from './Player';`

### 3. **Useless Camera Assignment in MainScene.ts**
**Location:** `client/src/scenes/MainScene.ts:56`
**Problem:** Line contained `this.camera = this.camera;` which does nothing.
**Fix:** Removed the useless line completely.

### 4. **MultiplayerManager Emit Recursion Issue**
**Location:** `client/src/managers/MultiplayerManager.ts`
**Problem:** The `emit()` method was calling local listeners when sending to server, causing confusion between server events and client events.
**Fix:** 
- Separated concerns by creating a new `triggerLocalListeners()` private method
- Modified `emit()` to only send to server
- Updated `setupSocketListeners()` to use `triggerLocalListeners()` for incoming server events
- Added missing event listeners for `playersListUpdate`, `gameStart`, and `playerGoldUpdate`

### 5. **Invalid TextInput Usage in LobbyScene.ts**
**Location:** `client/src/scenes/LobbyScene.ts`
**Problem:** Used `ex.Input.TextInput` which doesn't exist in the Excalibur API.
**Fix:** 
- Replaced TextInput with a Label displaying the player name
- Added keyboard event handling to allow typing player name (A-Z keys and Backspace)
- Player name is stored in a class property and updated via keyboard input

### 6. **Missing Game Loop in Server**
**Location:** `server/src/GameRoom.ts`
**Problem:** Server had no game loop to update zombie AI and broadcast game state to clients.
**Fix:**
- Added `gameLoop` timer property
- Created `startGameLoop()` method that runs every 50ms (20 FPS)
- Created `updateGame()` method that:
  - Updates zombie AI targets
  - Broadcasts game state to all players in the room
- Modified constructor to accept `io` socket.io instance
- Called `startGameLoop()` in `startGame()` method

### 7. **Memory Leaks - Missing Timer Cleanup**
**Location:** `server/src/GameRoom.ts` and `server/src/server.ts`
**Problem:** Timers (waveTimer, shopTimer, gameLoop) were never cleaned up when rooms were deleted.
**Fix:**
- Added `cleanup()` method in GameRoom that clears all timers
- Modified `server.ts` to call `gameRoom.cleanup()` before deleting empty rooms (in both `leaveLobby` and `disconnect` handlers)
- Updated GameRoom constructor to accept io instance parameter

## Additional Issues to Consider

### Type Safety Issues
- Many uses of `any` type in the codebase (especially in Building.ts, Zombie.ts, Resource.ts when accessing scene properties)
- Consider using proper TypeScript interfaces for scene properties

### Resource Loading
- ResourceManager loads resources but MainScene also tries to load them
- Images/sounds are loaded but files may not exist (no assets folder mentioned)
- No error handling for missing assets

### Game Loop Performance
- Server broadcasts entire game state 20 times per second which could be bandwidth intensive
- Consider implementing delta updates (only send changed entities)

### Shop Timer
- ShopTimer in GameRoom is declared but never started (shopTimer property is set but never used with setInterval/setTimeout)

### Map Serialization
- GameState contains Map objects which don't serialize properly to JSON
- Socket.io may have issues sending Map objects - consider converting to arrays or plain objects

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test player connections and disconnections
2. Verify zombie AI updates properly
3. Check for memory leaks after multiple games
4. Test multiplayer synchronization
5. Verify resource collection works correctly
6. Test building placement and turret shooting
7. Verify shop functionality
